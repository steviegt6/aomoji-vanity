Aomoji Resource Packs API

This mod serves as an API that allows mods to register their own resource packs to do numerous different things:
- replace vanilla textures,
- (optionally) mandate their texture packs are always enabled,
- allow users to decide what texture overrides take precedence,
- allow resource packs to replace modded resources.

This allows for functionality extremely similar to Minecraft mods, if you are at all familiar.

Some planned features:
- the ability to declare custom item animations,
- the ability to disobey texture size restrictions(?, risky, can cause hitbox issues).

This API is free software licensed under the Affero GNU General Public License, version 3.0.
Any mods that use this API must be licensed under the same license or a later version of it.
